# Lottery Smart Contract

A decentralized lottery smart contract built with Solidity and Hardhat. Players can join by paying exactly 0.01 ETH, and when 10 players have joined, a winner is automatically selected to receive the entire prize pool.

### Key Functions

- `enterLottery()`: Join the lottery by sending exactly 0.01 ETH
- `getPlayers()`: View current players in the lottery
- `getPlayerCount()`: Get the number of current players
- `getCurrentPrizePool()`: View the current prize pool amount
- `getLotteryInfo()`: Get comprehensive lottery information

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone and Install Dependencies**

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Join the lottery
await lottery.enterLottery({ value: ethers.parseEther("0.01") });

// View lottery information
const [lotteryId, playerCount, prizePool, currentPlayers] =
  await lottery.getLotteryInfo();
```

## Gas Optimization

- Custom errors instead of require statements
- Efficient storage patterns
- Optimized loops (while instead of for)
- OpenZeppelin's gas-optimized contracts

## Security Considerations

- Reentrancy protection on all external calls
- Input validation for all functions
- Secure pseudo-random number generation
- Prevention of duplicate entries
- Automatic contract state management

## Events

- `PlayerJoined(address indexed player, uint256 indexed lotteryId)`
- `WinnerSelected(address indexed winner, uint256 prizeAmount, uint256 indexed lotteryId)`
- `LotteryReset(uint256 indexed newLotteryId)`

## Deployment
