## Task

- Create a Token-Gated DAO using ERC-7432: Non-Fungible Token Roles

### Goal:

- Implement a DAO where governance participation (voting, proposals, and access to DAO resources) is gated by roles attached to NFTs via ERC-7432: Non-Fungible Token Roles.
  Instead of simply checking NFT ownership, the DAO will validate specific roles on NFTs to determine member permissions.
