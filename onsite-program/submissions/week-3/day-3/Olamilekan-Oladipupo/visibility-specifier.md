#  Solidity Visibility Specifiers

In Solidity, visibility specifiers determine how and where functions and variables can be accessed. There are four main visibility specifiers: private, public, external, and internal.


 Private

- private is a visibility specifier for both variables and functions.
- Variables or functions marked private can only be accessed within the same contract where they are declared.
- Contracts that inherit from the parent contract cannot access private variables or functions.


Public

- public is a visibility specifier for both variables and functions.
- Public members can be accessed both inside and outside the contract.
- Contracts that inherit from the parent contract can access public variables and functions.
- Note: Public state variables automatically get a getter function in Solidity.



External

- external is a visibility specifier used only for functions.
- External functions are meant to be called from outside the contract.

- Contracts that inherit from the parent contract cannot call external functions directly.

Internal

- internal is a visibility specifier for both variables and functions.
- Internal members can be accessed within the same contract and from derived contracts(contracts that inherit from it).
- They are not accessible externally.
