1. Lottery Smart Contract
Design and implement a Lottery smart contract with the following requirements:
1. Entry Rule
- A user can join the lottery by paying exactly 0.01 ETH (or a set entry fee).
- Multiple players can join.
2. Player Tracking
- Store the list of participants' addresses.
3. Random Winner Selection
- Once 10 players have joined, the contract automatically picks a winner.
- The winner receives the entire prize pool.
4. Events
- Emit events when a player joins and when a winner is chosen.
5. Security Considerations
- Prevent anyone from calling the winner selection function except the contract itself when 10 players have joined.
- Ensure no one can enter twice in the same round.
- Reset the lottery after each round.
Part B: Testing
- Write unit tests (using Hardhat) that check:
1. Users can enter only with the exact fee.
2. The contract correctly tracks 10 players.
3. Only after 10 players, a winner is chosen.
4. The prize pool is transferred correctly to the winner.
5. The lottery resets for the next round.
Part C: Automated Script
- Write a deployment + interaction script with hardhat / foundry that:
1. Deploys the contract.
2. Adds 10 test accounts to join the lottery.
3. Displays the winner's address and updated balances.
4. Runs the lottery again to confirm it resets properly.
Part D: Deployment
- Deploy and verify the smart contract.
- Add the smart contract address to your readme file
