## ðŸš€ Complete the Setup

Your frontend is ready! Just need to install the remaining dependencies:

### Step 1: Install Wagmi Dependencies

```

### Step 2: Configure Contract Addresses

Update `.env` file with your deployed contract addresses:

```env
# Replace with your actual contract addresses
VITE_STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890
VITE_STAKING_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321

# Optional: Add your WalletConnect project ID
