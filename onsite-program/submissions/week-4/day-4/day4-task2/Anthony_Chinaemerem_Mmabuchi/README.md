# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
The Contract address for the TodoList: ``` 0x1598D6c8Dd59D88dD751792468885C341433982c ```
The Contract address for the Student Management System ``` 0x5D808A22403786c1a2D24bf451e67C029D045417 ```
