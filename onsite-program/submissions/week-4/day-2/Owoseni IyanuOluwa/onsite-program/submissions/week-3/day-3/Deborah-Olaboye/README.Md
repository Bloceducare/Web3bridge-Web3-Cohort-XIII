### Visibility Specifiers

*Public Functions and Variables*  
Public functions and variables can be accessed from anywhere. Solidity automatically creates a getter function for a variable declared using public. Therefore, there is no need to explicitly define the get() method for a variable declared publicly.

---

*Private Functions and Variables*  
Private functions and variables are only accessible within the smart contract where they were declared and cannot be accessed outside the smart contract. Private functions are mostly utilized for utility functions.

---

*Internal Functions and Variables*  
Internal functions and variables can only be accessed from within the contract that declares them and also from the child contract that inherits the parent contract where they are declared. Storage variables have internal visibility by default.

---

*External Functions*  
External visibility only applies to functions and they can only be called from outside the contract where they are declared. They cannot be called from inside the contract or its child contract.
