In Solidity, visibility specifiers define how and where variables and functions can be accessed in a smart contract. They control the scope and accessibility of code components.This is a summary of visibility specifiers for variables and functions in Solidity.

Visibility Specifiers in Solidity
Solidity has four visibility specifiers: public, private, internal, and external. These apply to both variables and functions, though their behavior differs slightly depending on the context.

1. Public
What it means: Accessible from everywhere—inside the contract, derived contracts, other contracts, and externally (e.g., via transactions or external accounts).
Variables:
Automatically generates a getter function to read the variable’s value.
Anyone can read the variable (e.g., via a blockchain explorer or external call).
Example: uint public myNumber = 42; (creates a getter function to read myNumber).
Functions:
Can be called internally (within the contract), by derived contracts, other contracts, or externally.
Example: function doSomething() public { ... } (callable from anywhere).
Use case: When you want a variable or function to be openly accessible, like public data or an entry point for users.

2. Private
What it means: Only accessible within the contract where it’s defined. Not accessible by derived contracts, other contracts, or externally.
Variables:
Can only be read or modified by functions within the same contract.
Example: uint private secretNumber = 100; (only contract’s functions can access secretNumber).
Functions:
Can only be called by other functions within the same contract.
Example: function hiddenLogic() private { ... } (only callable inside the contract).
Use case: For sensitive data or internal logic that shouldn’t be exposed outside the contract.

3. Internal
What it means: Accessible within the contract and in derived contracts (contracts that inherit from it). Not accessible externally or by other contracts.
Variables:
Can be read or modified by the contract and its derived contracts.
Example: uint internal familySecret = 200; (accessible in the contract and its child contracts).
Functions:
Can be called by the contract and its derived contracts.
Example: function internalLogic() internal { ... } (callable by the contract or its children).
Use case: For data or logic that should be shared with derived contracts but not exposed externally.

4. External
What it means: Only accessible from outside the contract (e.g., by other contracts or external accounts). Not callable internally unless using this.
Variables:
Cannot be declared external. This specifier is only for functions.
Example: uint external myVar; (will cause a compilation error).
Functions:
Can only be called by external accounts or other contracts, not directly within the contract (unless using this.functionName()).
Example: function externalAction() external { ... } (only callable externally).
Note: Using external can save gas for functions meant to be called only from outside.
Use case: For functions designed as public interfaces for other contracts or users, optimizing gas usage.

Key Notes in Using Visibility Specifiers In Solidity
Default Visibility:
Variables: Default to internal if no visibility is specified.
Functions: Default to public if no visibility is specified (Solidity versions before 0.7.0; always specify explicitly for clarity).
Inheritance: Derived contracts can access internal and public members of the parent contract but not private ones.
Gas Efficiency: external functions are slightly cheaper for external calls since they don’t need to handle internal call overhead.
Security: Use private or internal for sensitive data or logic to limit exposure. Be cautious with public, as anyone can read or call it.
