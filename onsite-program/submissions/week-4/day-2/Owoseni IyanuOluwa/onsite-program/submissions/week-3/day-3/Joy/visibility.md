As developers, the visibility you choose for functions and variables is important for security because it controls who can access them and helps protect your smart contract from unwanted interactions.

There are four(4) types of visibility specifiers in solidity. They control how functions and variables can be accessed;
1. Public: This makes the functions available anywhere e.g in the smart contract and externally. It also automatically creates a get function that makes the variables readable anywhere. All variables are declared public automatically, except declared otherwise.

example: contract Bank {
    uint256 public totalDeposits; // Anyone can check the bank's total deposits
    
    function deposit() public payable {
        // Anyone can deposit money
        totalDeposits += msg.value;
    }
} //this allows for anyone to walk in the bank and see the total deposits display


2. Private: This makes functions and variables available only within the smart contract that they are defined. It is not inherited by derived contracts. It is the most restrictive visibility specifier

example: contract Bank {
    uint256 private ownerSalary; // Only this contract knows the owner's salary
    
    function calculateTax() private pure returns (uint256) {
        // Only internal bank calculations can use this
        return 1000;
    }
} //this allows only the account owner to read it their own balance. no-one else can see it, not even their kids


3. Internal: This makes fuctions and variables accessible within the same contract and any contracts that inherit from it.

example: contract Bank {
    uint256 internal reserves; // This bank and its branches can access
    
    function processLoan() internal {
        // Only this bank and its subsidiary banks can process loans
        reserves -= 1000;
    }
}

contract LocalBranch is Bank {
    function checkReserves() public view returns (uint256) {
        return reserves; // Can access parent's internal variable
    }
}  //this is like a family business secret - the account owner and their children know, but outsiders don't


4. External: This makes functions callable from outside the contract and any contracts that inherit from it (externally or through this.functionName()). It is not applicable to variables because variables cannot be declared as external. It is also more gas-efficient than public for functions when called externally. They cannot be called directly from within the same contract (unless using this)

example: contract Bank {
    function withdrawATM(uint256 amount) external {
        // Only customers from outside can use ATM
        // Bank employees must use this.withdrawATM() if needed internally
    }
}   //this is just like our stand alone ATM machines, only people outside have access to it from outside the bank building, but the staff inside can't use it directly
