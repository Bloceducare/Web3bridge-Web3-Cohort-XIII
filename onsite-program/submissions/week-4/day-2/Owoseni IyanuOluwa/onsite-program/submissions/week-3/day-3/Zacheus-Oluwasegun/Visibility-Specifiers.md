# Solidity Visibility Specifiers Summary

## Brief Overview

Visibility specifiers in Solidity control who can access your contract's variables and functions. Think of them as security levels: **public** means anyone can access it, **external** (functions only) means only outsiders can call it, **internal** means only your contract and its children can use it, and **private** means only your specific contract can access it. The key thing to remember is that these only control programmatic access between contracts - all data on the blockchain remains publicly viewable to anyone examining the blockchain directly.

## Visibility Specifiers Comparison

### Specifiers Available for Both Variables and Functions

**public**
- **Variables**: Automatically generates getter functions, which allows other contracts to read their values.
- **Functions**: Can be called both internally and externally, part of the contract interface

**internal** 
- **Variables**: This is the default visibility level for state variables. It is accessible within the contract and derived contracts.
- **Functions**: Accessible within current contract and derived contracts. They cannot be accessed externally

**private**
- **Variables**: private as the name implies, only accessible within the defining contract
- **Functions**: Only accessible within the defining contract, not inherited by derived contracts. same as variables

### Function-Only Specifiers

**external**
- Only applies to functions
- Part of the contract interface for transactions and inter-contract calls
- Cannot be called internally without using `this.functionName()`
- More gas-efficient for large data parameters

## Key Differences by Type

### Variables vs Functions Access Patterns

**Variables:**
- Public variables get automatic getter functions
- Internal is the default visibility level
- No setter functions are auto-generated for public variables

**Functions:**
- External functions cannot be called internally without `this.`
- Public functions offer dual access (internal and external)
- Internal functions can accept complex types like mappings and storage references

### Inheritance Behavior

**Inherited by Derived Contracts:**
- Internal variables and functions
- Public variables and functions

**Not Inherited:**
- Private variables and functions
- External functions (but can still be called externally)

## Security Considerations

All visibility Specifiers only control contract-level access. Private and internal Specifiers do not provide true privacy since all blockchain data remains publicly visible to external observers. They only prevent other contracts from accessing the information programmatically.
