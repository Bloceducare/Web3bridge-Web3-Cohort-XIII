# Understanding Visibility in Solidity

When you're building smart contracts with Solidity, you define **functions** (actions your contract can perform) and **state variables** (data your contract stores, like numbers, text, or true/false values). To control who can see or use these, Solidity gives you special keywords called **visibility specifiers**. Think of them like permissions or access levels.


## The Four Access Levels

Solidity offers four main visibility specifiers:

### 1\. `private`

This is the most restrictive.

  * **What it means:** Only the contract where it's defined can see or use it. No other contracts, not even ones that inherit from it, can access `private` elements.
  * **When to use it:** When you have data or a function that's purely for the contract's internal workings and shouldn't be exposed to anyone else.
  * **Analogy:** Imagine a **personal diary** that only *you* can read.

### 2\. `internal`

This offers a bit more access than `private`.

  * **What it means:** The contract itself can use it, and so can any other contracts that are built *on top* of it (contracts that **inherit** from it).
  * **When to use it:** When you want a function or variable to be shared among a family of related contracts but not exposed to the outside world.
  * **Analogy:** This is like **family-only information** that's shared within your immediate family but not with outsiders.

### 3\. `public`

This is the most open option.

  * **What it means:** Anyone can access it â€“ from inside the contract, from other contracts, or even from external users interacting with your contract.
  * **When to use it:** When you want to provide a way for people or other contracts to interact with your contract's data or functions.
  * **Extra cool thing:** If you declare a **state variable** as `public`, Solidity automatically creates a function that lets anyone easily read its value. This is super handy\!

### 4\. `external`

This specifier is specifically for functions.

  * **What it means:** These functions can *only* be called from *outside* the contract. You cannot call an `external` function directly from within the same contract using just its name.
  * **When to use it:** Ideal for functions that are meant to be entry points for other users or systems interacting with your contract, but not for internal operations within the contract itself.
  * **Important note:** If, for some reason, you *do* need to call an `external` function from within the same contract, you'd have to use a special syntax like `this.functionName()`. However, typically, `external` functions are designed for external calls.


## Quick Reference Table

| Visibility   | Who Can Access It?                  |
|--------------|-------------------------------------|
| `private`    | Only **this** contract              |
| `internal`   | This contract **and** any derived ones |
| `public`     | **Anyone**, inside or outside       |
| `external`   | **Only from outside** the contract  |


## Tips for Beginners: Keep It Simple\!

When you're just starting out, don't get bogged down by all the nuances. Here's a simple approach:

  * **Start with `public` or `private`**. These are the most common and straightforward.
  * Use `public` when you want a function or variable to be visible and usable by anyone (users, other contracts).
  * Use `private` when you want to keep something completely hidden and only for the contract's internal use.
  * **Don't worry too much about `internal` and `external` right away.** They'll make more sense as you build more complex contracts and understand inheritance and external interactions better.


## A Simple Example (No Need to Run It\!)

Let's look at how these might appear in a basic contract:

```solidity
// This contract demonstrates different visibility specifiers
contract VisibilityDemo {

    // Anyone can read the value of 'myNumber' because it's public.
    uint public myNumber;

    // Only this 'VisibilityDemo' contract can use or change 'mySecret'
    // because it's private.
    string private mySecret;

    // This function can be called by anyone to see 'myNumber'.
    function showNumber() public view returns (uint) {
        return myNumber;
    }

    // This function can only be called from inside this contract
    // to set the 'mySecret' value.
    function setSecret(string memory _secret) private {
        mySecret = _secret;
    }

    // This function can be called by anyone from outside the contract.
    // It's a good entry point for external interactions.
    function doSomethingExternal() external {
        // ... some logic that can only be triggered externally ...
    }

    // This function can be called by this contract or any contract
    // that inherits from VisibilityDemo.
    function internalCalculation() internal pure returns (uint) {
        return 10 * 5;
    }
}
```
