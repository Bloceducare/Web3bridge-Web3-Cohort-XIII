1. **LootBox.sol** - Main contract with complete functionality
   - Chainlink VRF integration for secure randomness
   - Weighted probability system with 5 rarity levels
   - Support for ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 rewards
   - Comprehensive access controls and security measures
   - Emergency functions and pausable functionality

2. **ILootBox.sol** - Complete interface definition
   - All function signatures and events
   - Comprehensive data structures
   - Clear documentation for integration

3. **WeightedRandom.sol** - Gas-optimized library
   - Binary search algorithm for O(log n) complexity
   - Cumulative weight preparation for efficiency
   - Probability calculation utilities
   - Input validation and error handling

#### Mock Contracts (for testing)
1. **MockERC20.sol** - Full ERC20 implementation with minting
2. **MockERC721.sol** - Complete ERC721 with enumerable extension
3. **MockERC1155.sol** - Full ERC1155 multi-token implementation
4. **MockVRFCoordinator.sol** - VRF coordinator mock for testing

### ✅ Technical Features Implemented

- **RARE**: 15% probability (1500/10000)
- **EPIC**: 4% probability (400/10000)
- **LEGENDARY**: 1% probability (100/10000)

#### Security Features
- OpenZeppelin security patterns (Ownable, ReentrancyGuard, Pausable)
- Comprehensive input validation
- Safe token transfer operations
- Emergency withdrawal functions
- Access control for all administrative functions

#### Gas Optimizations
- Efficient storage layout
- Binary search for weighted selection
- Optimized event emission
- Reusable library functions
