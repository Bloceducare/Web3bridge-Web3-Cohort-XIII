# 🎲 Lottery Smart Contract

A comprehensive lottery smart contract implementation that meets all the specified requirements from your assignment.

## 📋 Features Implemented

### ✅ Entry Rules
- **Fixed Entry Fee**: Users can join by paying exactly 0.01 ETH
- **Single Entry**: Multiple players can join, but each address can only join once per round
- **Player Limit**: Maximum of 10 players per lottery round

### ✅ Player Tracking  
- **Address Storage**: Stores list of all participants' addresses
- **Participation Tracking**: Tracks which addresses have joined the current round
- **Player Count**: Real-time count of current participants

### ✅ Random Winner Selection
- **Automatic Selection**: Once 10 players join, the contract automatically picks a winner
- **Pseudo-Random**: Uses block timestamp, difficulty, and other factors for randomness
- **Prize Distribution**: Winner receives the entire prize pool (10 × 0.01 ETH = 0.1 ETH)

### ✅ Events
- **PlayerJoined**: Emitted when a player joins
- **WinnerSelected**: Emitted when a winner is chosen  
- **LotteryReset**: Emitted when lottery resets for new round
- **PrizePoolUpdated**: Emitted when prize pool changes

### ✅ Security Considerations
- **Owner Controls**: Only contract owner can manually select winner or pause lottery
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- **Access Control**: Uses OpenZeppelin's Ownable for admin functions
- **Input Validation**: Prevents duplicate entries and incorrect fees
- **Emergency Functions**: Owner can pause lottery and emergency withdraw

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) installed
- Git installed

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
forge install OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts
```

2. **Compile Contracts**
```bash
forge build
```

3. **Run Tests**
```bash
forge test -v
```

### 🧪 Testing

#### Run All Tests
```bash
forge test
```

#### Run Tests with Verbose Output
```bash
forge test -vvv
```

#### Run Specific Test
```bash
forge test --match-test testJoinLotterySuccess -vvv
```

#### Test Coverage
```bash
forge coverage
```

### 📊 Test Results Expected

The test suite covers:
- ✅ Contract deployment and initialization
- ✅ Entry fee validation (correct/incorrect amounts)
- ✅ Duplicate entry prevention  
- ✅ Multiple players joining
- ✅ Automatic winner selection at 10 players
- ✅ Lottery reset after winner selection
- ✅ Manual winner selection (owner only)
- ✅ Lottery pause/unpause functionality
- ✅ Access control (owner vs non-owner)
- ✅ Emergency withdrawal
- ✅ Event emissions
- ✅ Reentrancy protection
- ✅ Fuzz testing for entry fees

## 🔧 Deployment

### Local Deployment (Anvil)

1. **Start Local Node**
```bash
anvil
```

2. **Deploy Contract**
```bash
forge script script/DeployLottery.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 --broadcast
```

### Testnet Deployment (Sepolia)

1. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
export SEPOLIA_RPC_URL=your_sepolia_rpc_url_here
```

2. **Deploy to Sepolia**
```bash
forge script script/DeployLottery.s.sol --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast --verify
```

## 🎮 Interaction

### Using Cast (Command Line)

1. **Check Lottery Info**
```bash
cast call LOTTERY_ADDRESS "getLotteryInfo()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

2. **Join Lottery**
```bash
cast send LOTTERY_ADDRESS "joinLottery()" --value 0.01ether --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

3. **Get Player Count**
```bash
cast call LOTTERY_ADDRESS "getPlayerCount()" --rpc-url http://localhost:8545
```

### Using Interaction Script

```bash
forge script script/InteractLottery.s.sol --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Randomness**: The current implementation uses pseudo-randomness which is not suitable for production. For production use, integrate with Chainlink VRF.

2. **Gas Optimization**: The contract is optimized for readability and security over gas efficiency.

3. **Testing**: Always test thoroughly on testnets before mainnet deployment.

4. **Security**: The contract includes basic security measures but should undergo professional audit before production use.
